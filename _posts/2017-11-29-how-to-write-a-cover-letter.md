<h2>Amongst a Sea of Competition</h2>

Any job worth having is going to have a very competitive hiring process. Qualified applicants from far and wide line up to submit resumes to top companies - so you better make damn sure you stand out!  "If they only knew the kind of person I was", you think. "I hope they give me a chance to meet them face to face and show them I'm the one". You HAVE that chance from day zero! By allocating additional time to writting cover letters, you make yourself a more unique and enticing candidate.  Continue reading to learn my four-step formula for the perfect cover letter.   


<h2>When Should I Send A Cover Letter?</h2>
Now, don't AWLAYS need to write a cover letter. Effeciency is a thing after all, and if you're serious about your job hunt then you are trying to apply to as many places as possible. You'll have your A-Tier Dream Job Category, B-Tier Runner-Up Job Category, and your C-Tier Safety-Net Job Category. ABSOLUTELY write cover letters for any A-Tier jobs you apply to. If you need a job sooner rather than later or have plenty of spare time, write a cover letter to your B-Tier jobs. Your c-tier jobs are jobs you don't really want but are applying to just in case. It is completely up to you on whether or not you want to spend time writing cover letters to these jobs. I personally did, as it gave me good practice and generally incrased my response rates. 


<h2>Why You NEED to Write A Cover-Letter</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It allows you to convey personality in a way that your resume doesn't</li>
	<li>You can demonstrate alignment between the company's mission and your life experience/interests </li>
	<li>You can quickly show that your own values match that of the companies</li>
	<li>You can talk about why you love the work you do and hope to do for them. Who wants to hire a lifeless work horse? </li>
</ul>

<h2> The Four-Step Plan.</h2>

Writing a cover letter can be broken down into four key steps. These steps make it easy to keep each paragraph concise and on point.

Key paragraphs: 
<ol>
	<li>Introduction and personal connection</li>
	<li>Frame your winning personality</li>
	<li>Frame recent job-relevant accomplishments</li>
	<li>Restate and extend.</li>
</ol>

In the following sections, we'll be breaking down an actual cover letter that I sent to an image processing startup in San Francisco. I was quite interested in this company and spent a lot of time on this cover letter. It got me a phone screen rather quickly, and even helped propel me to a final meeting with the CEO. Keep reading if you want to learn how to write a cover letter that gets you that face-to-face you know you deserve.

<h2>Paragraph 1: Introduction and personal connection</h2>
All conversations start with an introduction. Here, you set the tone and introduce yourself, your interest, and establish a personal connection to the company and their mission. 

Spend some time on the company website and focus on the about page. Usually, you will find the company's mission boiled down into a single sentence. Reflect on yourself and your motivations and find a genuine personal connection to that mission. This is KEY, as it communicates the fact that you aren't only interested for the paycheck. Rather, you are invested in the growth of this company as a whole and are willing to work hard in order to further their cause. As always, keep it genuine. Do not force a connection or apply somewhere that is not congruent to your values - it will only make you miserable.

You'll want to wrap up this paragraph with a single sentence that provides an inticing reason for them to be interested in you. Briefly go over the skills and expertise that you will delve into in the following paragraphs.
