<h2>If They Only Knew.</h2>

Have you ever read a job listing that you knew you were PERFECT for? Your experience, background, interests, and upbringing have molded you into the ideal hire for this role and the responsibilities that come with it. You send off your application and resume and nervously wait. Days pass and you wonder if they've thrown your application out, or if they've even gotten to it all! "If they only knew the kind of person I was", you think. "I hope they give me a chance to meet them face to face and tell them I'm their right guy". You HAD that chance! You could have written a cover letter! But instead, you decided to allocate the extra time it takes writting cover letters towards sending out more applications in bulk. The old-age adage, quality not quantity rings true. By choosing to have more time to send more applications, you have sabotaged yourself in the applications that really mattered. Continue reading to learn my four-step formula for the perfect cover letter.   

<h2>When Should I Send A Cover Letter?</h2>
Now, don't AWLAYS need to write a cover letter. Effeciency is a thing after all, and if you're serious about your job hunt then you are trying to apply to as many places as possible. You'll have your A-Tier Dream Job Category, B-Tier Runner-Up Job Category, and your C-Tier Safety-Net Job Category. ABSOLUTELY write cover letters for any A-Tier jobs you apply to. If you need a job sooner rather than later or have plenty of spare time, write a cover letter to your B-Tier jobs. Your c-tier jobs are jobs you don't really want but are applying to just in case. It is completely up to you on whether or not you want to spend time writing cover letters to these jobs. I personally did, as it gave me good practice and generally incrased my response rates. 

<h2>Why You NEED to Write A Cover-Letter</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It allows you to convey personality in a way that your resume doesn't</li>
	<li>You can demonstrate alignment between the company's mission and your life experience/interests </li>
	<li>You can quickly show that your own values match that of the companies</li>
	<li>You can talk about why you love the work you do and hope to do for them. Who wants to hire a lifeless work horse? </li>
</ul>
