<h2>And Hearts;</h2>
So... you want to learn to code. For whatever reason you have ended up staring at the approximately 642,000k results that a Google search has brought you. You stare at complex articles and lessons and recall adding <a href="http://easy-html-tutorials.tumblr.com/fallingheartspreview" target="_blank">falling hearts</a> to your MySpace profile back in 2007 and wonder if that's enough to get you by. You're actually not entirely off base. Those hearts are created by HTML and CSS, two of the core technologies for building web pages. HTML defines the content structure, while CSS provides visual layout. At it's core, the code you copied and pasted to your MySpace page probably looked something like this: 

{% highlight html %}
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="down" scrollamount="5" style="position:absolute; left:130px; top:150px;height:548px;">
	<span style="color:#FFFFFF !important;">â™¥</span> 
</marquee> 
{% endhighlight %}

"Sorry to be 'that guy', but HTML isn't a programming language. It's a markup language." How right you are kind sir! This is where JavaScript comes into play, the third element of the web development trinity. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages you create. With JS you can dynamically change the content of your HTML, change CSS style on the fly, calculate complex math equations in seconds, trigger events, the list is endless! 

In review:

* HTML defines the content of web pages
* CSS specifies the layout and design of web pages
* JavaScript programs the behavior of web pages and their elements

It is for this reason that I recommend Javascript as the foundation to a emerging programmer's curriculum.

<h2>Step 1: Baby Steps</h2> 
You will first want to get comfortable with JavaScript's syntax, capabilities, and even write some basic functions. I consider baby steps and hand-holding tutorials vital in order to build both your familiarity and confidence (this is a funny word to us programmers, as our confidence is fragile and easily crushed with the smallest of typos) as you begin your new journey.  

Above all else, I recommend <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript" target="_blank">Code Academy's Free JavaScript course</a> as your very first point of entry. The course is free, well-paced, heavily guided, and able to be tackled in chunks day by day in order to kick start your learning.

<h2>Step 2: Required Reading</h2>  
Congratulations! You learned the very basics of JavaScript. You coded along as an interactive web page (guess what it was coded with) guided your every key stroke. Nice work! But don't get too comfortable. 

My next recommendation would be to read the universally recommended <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-Modern-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593275846/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1481580180&sr=8-1&keywords=eloquent+javascript" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming</a>. This book dives deeper into the concepts you learned during Code Academy while maintaining a friendly and easy to read tone and even includes coding challenges for you to decipher. In particular, you should aim to master the first 5 chapters.


<h2>Step 3: Freestyle</h2>  
You can now pass a JavaScript vocabulary text, you know FizzBuzz like the back of your hand, and you have decided if you prefer tabs or spaces... but none of this knowledge seems practical. What now!?

It is important to bear in mind that the first phase of learning to code isn't about learning to code at all. It is about learning to learn. Over the previous two steps you have been exposing yourself to new skills and a new way of thinking and it's awesome that you've made it this far, but the next step will be to make your first web page. In the future I will be writting a blog post to guide you through setting up your local coding environment for the first time, as well as a walkthrough on how to make a simple "about me" page. 

For now, consider this bit of advice under construction. Take this time to go through Code Academy's HTML and CSS track or even to read Jon Duckett's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1118008189&pd_rd_r=YJ3Z4KM2TZVM85DSYERT&pd_rd_w=EEjtd&pd_rd_wg=1Baux&psc=1&refRID=YJ3Z4KM2TZVM85DSYERT" target="_blank">HTML and CSS</a>. 

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
Any programmer will tell you that learning to code was the most difficult thing they've ever had to do. They will also tell you that it has been the most fulfilling journey they've taken. I continue to refer to this as a "journey" because that's exactly what this is. If you've found yourself reading this post it is because you have the ingenuity and resourcefullness to tread off the beaten path and do your own research. Coding is a lifelong commitment. You will never stop learning. You will feel like a god, and you will feel like a loser. Often multiple times within the same day! 

A lot has happened since I completed my first free Code Academy lesson. I attended and graduated a coding bootcamp(more on that later), have taken on several freelance projects, have gotten a 9 to 5 job as a programmer, and can proudly call myself a working professional. I sincerely hope that this blog post has helped you in taking the first step on your own journey - wherever it may lead you.
