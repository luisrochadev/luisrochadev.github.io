<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Designed, coded, and implemented website with <a href="/b2b-website-anatomy/" target="_blank"> B2B website best practices </a> as well as SEO in mind (ranked in Top 10 for search query: San Diego Import and Export Company). Fully responsive, including a jQuery carousel that responds to touch on mobile devices.</p>

<p>This project also gave me the chance to get creative with animations. Long pages hosting static content can often feel stale. However, by A/B testing some tasteful animations - I ensured that viewers of the site stayed longer and interacted with the CTA more often. </p>
