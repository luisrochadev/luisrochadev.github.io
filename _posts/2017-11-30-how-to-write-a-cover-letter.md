<h2>Amongst a Sea of Competition</h2>

Any job worth having is going to have a very competitive hiring process. Qualified applicants from far and wide line up to submit resumes to top companies - so you better make damn sure you stand out!  "If they only knew the kind of person I was", you think. "I hope they give me a chance to meet them face to face and show them I'm the one". You HAVE that chance from day one! By allocating additional time to writing cover letters, you make yourself a more unique and enticing candidate. Cover letters are less robotic than resumes and allow you to show more of your personality and have a conversation with the reader about who you are and what you bring to the table. Continue reading to learn my four-step formula for the perfect cover letter that inspires hiring managers to rank your application on top of all the rest.   


<h2>When Should I Send A Cover Letter?</h2>
Now, don't AWLAYS need to write a cover letter. Efficiency is a thing after all... and if you're serious about your job hunt then you are trying to apply to as many places as possible. You'll have your A-Tier Gold Job Category, B-Tier Silver Job Category, and your C-Tier Bronze Job Category. ABSOLUTELY write cover letters for any A-Tier jobs you apply to. Decide whether or not to write a cover letter to your B-Tier jobs by determining how soon you need a job and how likely you are to accept an offer from these companies. Your c-tier jobs are jobs you don't really want but are applying to just in case. It is completely up to you on whether or not you want to spend time writing cover letters to these jobs. I personally wrote a cover letter to 90% I applied to, as it gave me good practice and helped increased my response rates.


<h2>Why You NEED to Write A Cover-Letter</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Convey personality in a way that your resume doesn't</li>
	<li>Establish rapport with a hiring manager before even meeting them</li>
	<li>Demonstrate alignment between the company's mission and your life experience/interests </li>
	<li>Quickly show that your own values match that of the companies</li>
	<li>Discuss why you love the work you do and hope to do for them </li>
</ul>

<h2> The Four-Step Plan.</h2>

Writing a cover letter can be broken down into four key steps. These steps make it easy to keep each paragraph concise and on point.

Key paragraphs: 
<ol>
	<li>Introduction and personal connection</li>
	<li>Frame your winning personality</li>
	<li>Frame recent job-relevant accomplishments</li>
	<li>Restate and extend.</li>
</ol>

In the following sections, we'll be breaking down an actual cover letter that I sent to an image processing startup in San Francisco. I was quite interested in this company and spent a lot of time perfecting this cover letter. It got me a phone screen rather quickly, and even helped propel me to a final meeting with the CEO. Keep reading if you want to learn how to write a cover letter that gets you that instrumental face-to-face. The names of companies mentioned have been changed.

<h2>Paragraph 1: Introduction and personal connection</h2>
All conversations start with an introduction. Here, you set the tone and introduce yourself, your interest in the position, and, most importantly, establish a personal connection to the company and their mission. 

Spend time on the company website and focus on the about page. Usually, you will find the company's mission boiled down into a single sentence. Reflect on yourself and your motivations and find a genuine personal connection to that mission. This is KEY, as it communicates the fact that you aren't only interested for the paycheck. Rather, you are invested in the growth of this company and are willing to work hard in order to further their cause. As always, keep it genuine. Do not force a connection or apply somewhere that is not congruent to your values - it will only make you miserable.

You'll want to wrap up this paragraph with a single sentence that provides an enticing reason for them to be interested in you. Briefly go over the skills and expertise that you will delve into in the following paragraphs.

<h2>Paragraph 2: Frame your winning personality</h2>
This is where you get to have some fun and show the company what a kick-ass person you are! Name any interesting accomplishments here in order to establish the fact that you are a unique individual who has been breaking necks and cashing checks their whole life. Valedictorian? Lead singer in a successful local band? Rescue someone stuck in a well? Look into your past and find interesting reasons that will not only prove that you are a successful individual, but also someone who stands out in a sea of applicants. Make sure your final tidbit is relevant to the job you're applying for. This will set-up the next paragraph where you discuss your relevant skills in detail.

<i>I’m a motivated self-starter at heart. My path towards becoming a web developer has been an incredible and diverse journey and I’ve learned so much along the way. I’ve launched a tech review channel on YouTube and was invited to the early-stage YouTube Partner Program at 8k subscribers. I’ve founded a photography business and gained high profile clients including Coachella, Outside Lands, and EDC. I’ve worked as a social media manager at RandomClothingCo and increased engagement by 60%. I’ve successfully put myself through coding bootcamp and graduated as a skilled, versatile developer.
