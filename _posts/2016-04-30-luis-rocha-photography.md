<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Photographers love spending hours tweaking and editing their online portfolio and I am no exception. Years ago I hosted my portfolio on Squarespace and grew frustrated with the limitations of the platform and the way my portfolio looked like everyone else's - so I made my own!</p>

<p>I sketched the layout, carefully selected each portfolio image, and coded a simple way for visitors to sort through my photography in a range of genres. This project let me get extremely creative and has a special place in my heart. Go ahead and check it out, the dynamic  masonry layout is really awesome. </p>
