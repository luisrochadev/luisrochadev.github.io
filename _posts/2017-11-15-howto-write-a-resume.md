<h2>Six: the Number of the Beast.</h2>

Having an impressive and easy to read resume is one of the simplest things you can do to improve your odds at scoring that sweet office job. It's also one of the hardest. A resume is meant to be an anthology of your collective skills <strong>relevant to the job you're applying to.</strong> A narrative detailing your of experience and preperation leading up to the interview for your dream job. Recruiters, however, do not care for your epic and will only spend an  <a href="https://cdn.theladders.net/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf" target="_blank">average of six seconds looking at your resume</a> before tossing it in the trash. With this in mind, it's crazy important that you make a good first impression in those precious six seconds. Here a few easy ways to do just that.

<h2> Keep it simple, stupid.</h2>
Say it with me now: "keep it simple, stupid." While we're at it: "keep it stupid simple!" Oftentimes, applicants try to reinvent the wheel and cook up what they consider a revolutionary new format for the resume. They throw in six different fonts, two infographics, and 3 columns with poor data architecture. A recruiter takes one look at this and, realizing he needs to read a six page manual on how to even decipher this thing, tosses it in the trash. 

Your resume should follow traditional formatting conventions and give the reader a good idea of who you are, what you do, and where you've done it in under a minute. Find a basic but good-looking template online and work from there. 

<ul>
	<li>Summary (who you are)</li>
	<li>Skills (what you can do)</li>
	<li>Education (Where you learned how to do it)</li>
	<li>Experience (What you've done)</li>
</ul>

Many people include an "objective" section, where you give a brief blurb about the kind of job you want and why you want it. I personally think you can leave it out, as you can go into greater detail about this in your cover letter and connect it to that specific company's mission (we'll talk about cover letters more next week, make sure you subscribe to my newsletter to stay up to date).

<h2>Summary: Who You Are</h2>
You summary section may also be referred to as your elevator pitch.  It is a blurb that tells a hiring manager who you are and what you're about in the same ammount of time you'd be on an elevator with them. This section should convey the following: what your title is/will be, what you're skilled at, why you enjoy what you do, and perhaps a small quip that extends on who you are or the attitude you bring to the job.

As you learned last week, I love speaking in analogies using cartoon characters as examples. So this week let's take a look at what Spongebob Squarepant's summary section might look like:

<em>Head cook with over 14 years of experience in managing operational aspects of fast food. Skilled at creating burgers that are healthy, delicious, and filling. Posesses a strict adherence to health standards and an excellent attitude. Commited to the satisfaction of the customer.<br>  The customer is always right. </em>

This is the perfect summary. Spongebob gives all the necessary details while humblebragging himself towards another 6 seconds of a recruiters attention.

<h2>Skills: What You Can Do</h2>
This is where you detail anything you can and have done that will help you crush this particular job. Tailor it to the role and the description on the job listing. 

When thinking of skills to list, it doesn't matter if you are an expert or a beginner. What recruiters want to see is at least a basic grasp of concepts that will be relevant on the job. In Spongebob's case, it doesn't matter if he is a pro on the deep fryer, the fact that he has used one on a prior job means he's already ahead of a candidate who hasn't. The same applies to a candidate who has dabbled in Excel, but prefers iWork Numbers. 

This is a great place to keyword stuff. Oftentimes, the first person who sees your resume is a recruiter or HR Manager who doesn't know how important certain skills will be in your day to day. Throw in any industry buzzword AS LONG AS ITS HONEST. Don't advertise that you're proficient in Excell if you've never opened the app (you know who you are). 

Spongebob's example: 
<em>
<ul>
<li>Bikini Bottom Food Handler's Permit</li>
<li>Expert on the grill and deep fryer</li>
<li>Skilled in utilizing different kinds of knives, appliances, etc</li>
<li>Neat, clean, professional appearance</li>

</ul>
</em>

<h2>Experience: What You've Done</h2>
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE RESUME. This is where you detail your past work experience including: where you worked, what your title was at that job, how long you worked there, and what you accomplished. Notice it says "what you accomplished" rather than "what you did". A common and costly mistake that applicants make in writing their resume is giving a basic overview of their duties at a previous job rather than the way they crushed those duties. Of course Spongebob grilled burgers while working as a fryc cook at The Krusty Crab. What's more impressive is how he managed and delivered thousands of grill orders at once for a mob of anchovies with no prep time.

Have a little fun in this section, humblebrag, toot your own horn! Any job worth having is going to have some competition, so be creative in finding ways that you excelled at your previous job. You may not think you did anything remarkable at your prior place of employment, but I promise you that if you take some time to reflect you'll realize your true contribution.

Spongebob's example:

<em>
<strong>The Krusty Krab</strong>
Fry Cook: 1999-2017
</em>
<ul>
	<li>Prepare specialty foods such a Krabby Patties and entrusted with their top-secret proprietary recipes. </li>
	<li>Operated large-volume cooking equipment including grills, deep fryers, and griddles while never having an accident on the job</li>
	<li>Maintained sanitation, health, and safety standards that exceeded all health inspections.</li>
	<li>Once served a mob of hungry anchovies without messing up a single order.</li>
</ul>
