B2B (business-to-business) marketing has many core differences when compared to individual consumer marketing. Business markets are smaller (316,000,000 potential individual customers vs 7,705,000 operating businesses in the US), demand is often derived from individual consumer demand, and the transactions are usually more complex. These factors as well as others affect the way B2B companies seek to attract new customers. It should be no surprise then that these companies have their own little nuances and best practices when it comes to their websites. The following is a list of industry standard components you should consider when building a B2B site. I've created this list based on my own research as well as experience working for B2B companies.

<h2>Industry Standard Components</h2>
<br>

<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
<p>
Should be easy to find but should not draw attention away from more important sections. The simpler a navigation bar is, the better - it should be natural for a user to find their way around the page. Secondary terms should be hidden or relocated to footer.</p>

<h3>Hero Element</h3>
<p>The most prominent, attention grabbing section of page, usually a full-width image featuring one or more people. A hero should be aesthetically pleasing and able to quickly draw a users attention. It is important that the hero element communicates who the product is intended for. </p>

<h3>Unique Value Proposition</h3>
<p>A company’s Unique Value Proposition is a succinct sentence which describes why their product is better than a competitor's and entices visitors to explore further. A UVP is usually a large, one-liner heading followed by a short subtitle. An effective UVP quickly conveys value and communicates what problems are solved by the product.</p>

<h3>Call To Action</h3>
<p>Call to action’s represent the key goal of a landing page, often designated via a button and/or form. The content of a CTA should be explicit and include personal pronounces (“my” vs “your”). Most users expect to find this at the top as well as bottom of a page.</p>

<br>

<h3>Product Benefits</h3>
<p>This section describes the benefits of a product by framing features as problem-solving attributes. This section is usually supplemented with illustrative icons the can quickly highlight a feature. Brief descriptions and links to a product page can be helpful in minimizing page length.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Social Proof</h3>
<p>Social proof eases user anxiety and further encourages users to participate in the CTA. Can be represented by recognized brand logos, text-based reviews, customer tweets, video testimonials, etc. SP has an enormous impact on user confidence and conversion.</p>
<br>
<h2>Final Observations</h2>
<p>Now is a good time to revisit B2B websites you have come across in the past (<a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, for example) and take note of the elements on their homepage. Do you find they include some or all the elements listed above? While there is not perfect recipe for a B2B homepage, consider the time and money spent by massive companies seeking to design their pages to maximize conversions. <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank"> Salesforce</a>, <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/" target="_blank"> Optimizely</a>, and others all showcase similar elements on their homepage. So no matter what sort of B2B product you or your client may be selling - incorporating these components is a great place to start.</p>
