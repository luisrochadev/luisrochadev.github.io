<h2>My Experience: A Collection of Contradictions</h2>

"There is a shit ton of money in tech. There are so many jobs out there that you won't know which to pick. Companies will be on their knees begging for you to work for them. Anyone can code." 

That was the narrative that motivated me to ditch all other plans, put life on hold, and enroll in the Galvanize six-month web development bootcamp back in 2015. I would spend Monday to Friday 9-5 immersed in code. "It's a full stack program. I learn front end and back end, which essentially means I'll be able to code up my own social network by the end the program", I remember saying to friends in the weeks leading up to Galvanize. Spoiler alert: NOPE. 

Upon graduation, I didn't know enough to code my own social network. I barely even knew enough to get through intense techincal interviews (no one told me I'd have to know what the hell "Big O" was until month 5 of 6). Somehow I managed to get into my first tech job 2 months later at a $75,000/year salary, which was a drastic improvement to the $15,000 I made as a photographer the year before. So my outlook on my experience should be overwhelmingly positive correct? Not so much. 

My coding bootcamp story is a collection of contradictions and in this blog post, I will share with you the good and bad as well as insight I've gained in the two years since. If you're even considering joining a coding botocamp, you owe it to yourself before you drop tens of thousands in tuition on the table. Keep reading and decide what's right for you:

<h2>The Short Answer</h2> 

Should you joing a coding bootcamp?<br>
<strong>Probably not</strong>. 

Yes, I just about sextupled my yearly income in less than a year. 
Yes, I got a job and remain employed. 
Yes, I formed deep and wonderful bonds with my classmates and instructors.
No, you probably shouldn't join a coding bootcamp.

Why? Well, there is a very particular set of reasons as to who should and shouldn't. Keep reading as I go deeper: 



<h2>What's Good about Coding Bootcamp</h2>

<h3>My instructors: </h3>
Liz Howard and Tyler Bettilyon are two brilliant programmers. They have big brains and even bigger hearts. Liz, in particular, really took the time to entertain all my questions after class about the local tech scene and taught my invaluable soft skills including how to effectively network, how to ask for someone to mentor you with tact, and really helped me find my "self" as a developer. Tyler was a fucking machine who I'm convinced was actually a sentient computer. He exuded ability. I consider myself fortunate to have learned from them.

<h3>The classroom experience:</h3>
There is something to be said about learning, struggling, and growing alongside a group of incredibly different students. It gives you confidence and makes you feel like you aren't alone in this journey you've decided to take. My classmates and I uplifted each other, helped one another understand concepts when they just didn't click, and shared so many laughs together. Seeing a classmate suceed while you struggle gives you the courage to keep trying. After all, they started in the same place as you... so you have no excuse. 

<h3>The routine:</h3>
How many times have you told yourself you would pursue a passion project after work or class? How many times have you actually followed through? Probably not many. When left to our own devices, humans will often get distracted or give up when trying to learn the difficult concepts associated with code. Hell, when I first started learning it took me an hour to figure out how to link my CSS and HTML. 

I thrive on routine. Coming into class at the same time every day and following a set schedule really helped me get into a high-performing state when it came to learning and thriving. I find it difficult to imagine actually learning basic web development on my own.

<h2>What's Bad about Coding Bootcamp</h2>

<h3>My instructor's hire date: </h3>
My head instructor was hired less than a month before the start of the program. When students are dropping  $15,000+ on a coding bootcamp and trusting you with their future this is NOT fucking acceptable. Tyler had also never taught in a bootcamp setting. He was a good teacher, but I heard from future classes that other instructors hired with little to no experience did not do even half as well at teaching. This is NOT a condemnation of my instructors as developers, teachers, or people. I treasure them dearly. 

<h3>There is a low standard for code: </h3>
When a student completed an assignment, an associate instructor (usually a recent graduate of the program) was supposed to check your work and give you feedback. What I found was that the associate instructor just checked if it worked or not. I receieved no feedback for the quality of my code and this killed me in take-home projects during my job hunt.

For example: Many projects I completed had inline styling. I was literally not told once that this would be unnaceptable in a professional environment as it isn't scalable. I absolutely missed out on good jobs for these kinds of oversights.

<h3>There is a low standard for admissions:</h3>
Fact: The admissions department for most coding bootcamps do not give a shit about you and see you as nothing more than a bag of money. The admissions test for Galvanize as well as many other bootcamps is an elementary programming game called "FizzBuzz". 

Coding bootcamps will accept you, even if you probably don't have the mind for code. Contrary to what the marketing says: <strong>not everyone can code</strong>. From what I have seen it either clicks with you or it doesn't. You are either consumed with passion for it, or you struggle to get through simmple tasks.  It was clear that at least 25% of my classmates were not suited for the program. 

<h3>The stats:</h3>
Less than half my graduating class of about 30 students currently holds a job as a web developer. Enough said. 

<h3>The industry ws a gold rush on decline:</h3>
Since I left Galvanize, several bootcamps have shut down, Galvanize has had huge lay-offs, and the market for entry-level devs has only gotten smaller. Those "piles of jobs" they talk about are for senior devs with over 5-years worth of experience. The market is flooded with entry level devs and bootcamp grads. The only way I was able to suceed was by deciding early on in the program that I would specialize in my expertise and not graduate as a jack-of-all-trades generic fullstack developer. 


<h2>How I Suceeded</h2>
Frontend development has to do with design and user experience of a website. Backend development works behind the scenes and involves databases, routing, and infrastructure. I realized early on that my background in photography and design gave me an edge in frontend. Also, backend made me awnt to tear my hair out. I decided that it would be strategic for me to specialize in a more specific set of skills so that I could stand out and apply for jobs that would make me happy. 

This ended up paying off. I was referred to a job by Galvanize's in-house admissions director based on the job description and the unique set of skills she knew I had. This led to a job where I was lucky to work very closely with my CEO, who really took me under his wing and taught me about conversion optimization, lead generation, and split testing. This led to a passion for developing with revenue growth in mind, which led me to my current job at the control group where I have increased revenue by at least 8% on four different pages for our in-house products. I love what I do and grateful every single day to have found this niche.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
Galvanize's objective was to turn me into a front end software enginner, and in this mission they utterly failed. I hate to say it... but its the truth. I am a front end developer who specialzies in conversion optimization. The technical skills that I use in my job day to day are quite straightforward as far as web development goes. Idea generation and an instinct for designing pages that make companies more money are skills I picked up in my first tech job under the tutelage of my CEO at the time.

However, I can't deny that Galvanize gave me a decent foundational understanding of web development as well as where to look and how to learn. So should you join a bootcamp? Should I have even joined? Who fucking knows. The answer remains: not really?
