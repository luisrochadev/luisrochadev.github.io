<h2>Get Started - NOW.</h2>
In a typical introduction paragraph, similair articles begin by listing reasons that you should learn to code. In 2018, most of you don't need convincing! The skill is in high demand, the pay is above the national average, and opportunities are plentiful. At least 3 times a week, friends and strangers online ask me about how I got my start as a web developer. In this week's blog post, I'll break down step-by-step just how I got my start along with some new and improved tips I can now offer through the benefit of hindight. 

These tips are <strong>straight-forward and easy to follow</strong> and are largely <strong>free of cost</strong>. The intention of this guide is to provide a free and simple outline so that anyone can take the first steps without any excuses. This guide is for everyone, from high school students to senior citizens. I am incredibly passionate about the tech field and want anyone who is interested in learning more to have open access to helpful information so that you can take advantage of the opportunities this field has to offer. With that being said, let's get started!


<h2>Web Dev 101: A Brief Introduction On Languages</h2>
Web Development is the practice of creating web pages with code. Each and every website you visit is compromised of several lines of easy to read, semantic code - no green Matrix alphabet soup here! Every web developer has 3 basic "languages" under their belt: <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. These languages are typed out in mostly plain english and are used to communicate with the computer and tell it what to do. Computers are both smart and stupid at the same time. They are extremely literal and can do just about ANYTHING you want them to in the blink of an eye - but the instructions have to be typed out perfectly. That's where coders come in.  

Quick definitions on the purpose of each coding language: 
* HTML defines the content of web pages
* CSS specifies the layout and design of web pages
* JavaScript programs the behavior of web pages and their elements

HTML presents the words you are reading right now, CSS is responsible for displaying my chosen font and colors, JavaScript made that e-mail sign up window that you saw when you entered my web site pop up to the very front of the page. 


As you can probably guess, JavaScript is more sophisticated than HTML and CSS. With JavaScript you can dynamically change the content of your HTML, change CSS style on the fly, calculate complex math equations in seconds, the list is endless! It's typically best practice to always start with your hardest task first. It is for this reason that I recommend you kick start your learning with JavaScript. Don't worry! It's not as scary as it sounds. Fundamental JavaScript is rather straight foward and easy to understand. We'll get you on the right track in the next section.

<h2>Baby Steps and Confidence Building</h2>
When first starting out, baby steps are vital. These small, easy to follow lessons serve to build up both your knowledge on coding basics as well as your confidence with the subject matter. This creates a snowball effect where the more confident you feel, the more you want to learn, which makes you even MORE confident so you spend MORE time learning etc etc etc. 

Time to give that snowball it's first little push!

Above all else, I recommend <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" target="_blank">Code Academy's Free JavaScript course</a> as your very first point of entry. The course is free, well-paced, heavily guided, and able to be tackled in chunks day by day in order to kick start your learning. The course has changed a bit since I first took it and includes optional "Pro" lessons at a cost. However, feel free to skip these as right now the free lessons are perfect for you. 

The reason I ALWAYS tell aspiring web developers to start with CodeAcademy is the way that the lessons gently and slowly present new concepts to you in a way that let's your brain digest it in bite-sized chunks. You'll finish every lesson feeling empowered and downright smarter! This feedback loop is addicting and had me spending weekend nights home alone instead of out with friends. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" target="_blank">Make sure you bookmark THIS link and get started on it as soon as you can!</a>


<h2>Baby Steps Continued</h2>  
Congratulations! You learned the very basics of JavaScript. You coded along as an interactive web page (guess what it was coded with) guided your every key stroke. Nice work! Now let's keep it going. 

Your next step is to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html" target="_blank"> learn the basics HTML on CodeAcademy </a>.
THEN, you will do the same <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css">and learn CSS.</a>

I'm sure you found the pacing for CodeAcademy's JavaScript course comfortable. Their HTML and CSS program folllows the same relaxed rhythm for concepts that are a lot simpler. HTML and CSS are a lot of fun to learn and use and follow simple patterns that you'll master in no time! Bookmark the above link so that you can start then once you finish the JavaScript Course.

(I should probaby take this time to mention that I am no sponsored by CodeAcademy in any way. The website was my entry into web development and I'm very grateful and passionate about their approach towards teaching beginners the basics.)


<h2>No More Training Wheels</h2>
Your next step is to read the universally recommended <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/3rd_edition/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming</a>. I have linked the FREE PDF, but you can also purchase the book on <a href="http://a.co/bjx8Xqt" target="_blank">Amazon </a> if you're more of a physical book kind of person. This book dives deeper into the concepts you learned during Code Academy while maintaining a friendly and easy to read tone and even includes coding challenges for you to decipher. In particular, you should aim to really understand the first 5 chapters. 

Reading this book will test you more than CodeAcademy did as, let's face it, reading a text book is not as fun as learning alongside an interactive website. This is a valuable time to train your focus and motivation towards the subject matter. Don't allow yourself to get distracted or give up. Remember why you wanted to get started in the first place and motivate yourself constantly.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
It is important to bear in mind that the first phase of learning is about learning how to learn. Over the previous steps you have been exposing yourself to new skills and a new way of thinking and it's awesome that you've made it this far! You've picked up on foundational coding skills that I along with more experiened programmers use EVERY DAY on the job.
