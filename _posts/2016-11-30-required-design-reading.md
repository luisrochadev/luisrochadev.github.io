In order for companies to stay competitive, their design language must be spectacular. As a front-end developer, it is your responsibilities to translate these design into pixel-perfect pages. Here are a few books to help get your own design chops to the next level.

Every aspect of front-end design is tackled thoroughly and thoughtfully. Though Kadavy can get a bit verbose, this is an absolutely crucial read.

One of the areas thatI notice developers stumble in the most is on choosing fonts. Sometimes a font choice does not match a project's identity. Other times the pairing between header font and body font clashes. No matter your project, being able to pick appropriate and legible fonts is an indispensable skill and this book will make you a typographic aficionado in no time.
