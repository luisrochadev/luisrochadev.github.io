<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>A primer for non-design oriented developers. The idea for Colorfontlogo came to me during my time at the Galvanize Web Development Immersive bootcamp. I noticed that many of my classmates were creating innovate and interesting full-stack projects whose perception was being negatively affected by their aesthetic decisions. I was often "the guy" to ask when it came to choosing fonts, color pairings, and layout. </p>

<p>With that in mind, I strived to create a simple, guided process with which my classmates could make more educated design decisions: and with that CFL was born. Based on hours of research into the psychology of color, legibility of fonts, industry trends, and more. CFL became an aggregate of my reasearch and a vehicle with which users can be guided through a series of mental primers and short lessons.</p>

<p>At the end of the process users can see a live layout using the design choices they chose themselves (shout out Angular data-binding), and even download that exact code (feature is currently in beta phase of iteration). </p>
