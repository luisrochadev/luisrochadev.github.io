	<p>Hello, my name is <strong>Luis Rocha</strong>. I live in <strong>San Francisco</strong> working as a front-end developer and love everything related to web development and design. I am obsessed with performance, responsive design, agile development, and creating clean and reusable code. </p>

	<p>A creative mind and self-starter at heart, I began self-publishing technology reviews on YouTube in 2007 and was invited to the early-stage YouTube Partner Program at 8k subscribers. After investing in a DSLR camera to improve the quality of my videos, I taught myself photography and changed course. I booked gigs via online self-promotion involving SEO, social media marketing, and countless cold emails. My efforts led me to a staff photographer and social media marketing job at Bay Area clothing brand, San Franpsycho. I also secured multi-year contracts with major West Coast festivals including Coachella, Outside Lands, and more. I then taught myself HTML and CSS in order to create a more effective website and grew obsessed with code and web technologies. In 2015, I went all in with my new passion and enrolled in the Galvanize Web Development Immersive Bootcamp and haven't stopped coding since. </p>

	<p>I'm a proven passionate problem solver. No matter what I undertake, I always find resourceful ways to ensure that project's success. I thrive on integrating my unique knowledge in design and marketing with the coding process. I am always learning. </p>
